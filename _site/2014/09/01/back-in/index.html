  <article class="post-content">
  <p>It&#39;s been five years since my last blog post on <a href="https://home.java.net/pub/au/95">java.net</a> -- amazingly still there. </p>

<p>The world changed a bit. Oracle bought Sun. I figured out how to start Matlab clusters on AWS for MathWorks. My first daughter was born. I taught myself some Scala. I left MathWorks for ActivateNetworks -- a social network analysis start-up (with more favorable intellectual property rules). My second daughter was born and is just about to start talking. My first daughter started kindergarten. I started working almost exclusively in Scala. I returned to open source work a few months ago with the first release of <a href="https://github.com/dwalend/ScalaGraphMinimizer">ScalaGraphMinimizer</a>, and I immediately started using it in my work to study how people communicate in their work. </p>

<p>I miss the challenge of writing, so adding the blog back feels natural. I&#39;ll mostly be describing what I find while I blunder through hobby projects. Many others are learning Scala, so hopefully what I have to say will be of some benefit to them (you?). The blog will be fairly technical, with lots of code examples. I&#39;ll also be dropping in my opinion of what I think works well. I&#39;ve been learning Scala largely in isolation, so I&#39;ll occasionally post something alien-looking. Feel especially free to call that out in the comments.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also a proponent of explicit coding. I want the code to be so clear that people can look at it and either agree that it is correct or be able to easily spot places where the code&#39;s behavior deviates from their expectations. Scala&#39;s ability to blend object and functional programming fits that well. I can use objects to tell a story. Functional-style programming makes the whole story visible. </p>

<p>Speakers at local MeetUps and conferences continue to surprise me with their praise of Scala. They talk about how writing Scala should be fun, and it usually is a blast. I&#39;ve mostly enjoyed writing code over the years, but had never seen people talk openly about anything the way Scala&#39;s proponents tell <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzf3hTUKk8U">how pleasant it is.</a>. They even talk about <a href="https://github.com/ktonga/reactive-turtle">love and parenting</a>. Further, the speakers at the Scala conferences and MeetUps are almost universally fit. Unlike so many in our profession, these people are jacked. They must have time to work out. I didn&#39;t get it until I started doing almost all my work in Scala. I&#39;ve gone from finishing just before deadlines to finishing with days or even whole weeks to spare. I use the time to polish my code, profile and speed it up, and to write extra tests. And then I get some exercise, horse around with my kids, work on open-source projects, and write a blog. </p>
